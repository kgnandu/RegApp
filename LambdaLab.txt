- Practice Lambdas:

	1) Create a Person class with a few properties

	2) Make your class be sortable by a "natural order".  You can decide what
	   that order should be.

 	3) Write a test program that creates a list of 5 person objects and test that
	   your sort implementation works.

	4) Sort your list using some order other than the natural order.  Use Lambda
	   expressions.

	5) Write a method that can filter your list based on criteria that you specify
	   as an argument.  Use the appropriate jdk8 method to specify the filter criteria.

	6) Test your filter method using lambda expressions.
